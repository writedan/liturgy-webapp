  Look with favor, Lord God, on our petitions,
  and in our trials grant us your compassionate help,
  that, consoled by the presence of your Son,
  whose coming we now await,
  we may be tainted no longer
  by the corruption of former ways.
  Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
  who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
  God, for ever and ever.

    text: |
      From the book of the prophet Isaiah.

      Yes, you have cast off your people,
      the House of Jacob;
      the land is full of soothsayers,
      full of sorcerers like the Philistines;
      they clap foreigners by the hand.
      His land is full of silver and gold
      and treasures beyond counting;
      his land is full of horses
      and chariots without number;
      his land is full of idols...
      They bow down before the work of their hands,
      before the thing their fingers have made.
      The mortal will be humbled, man brought low;
      do not forgive them.
      Get among the rocks,
      hide in the dust,
      at the sight of the terror of the Lord,
      at the brilliance of his majesty,
      when he arises
      to make the earth quake.

      Human pride will lower its eyes,
      the arrogance of men will be humbled.
      The Lord alone shall be exalted,
      on that day.
      Yes, that will be the day of the Lord of Hosts
      against all pride and arrogance,
      against all that is great, to bring it down,
      against all the cedars of Lebanon
      and all the oaks of Bashan,
      against all the high mountains
      and all the soaring hills,
      against all the lofty towers
      and all the sheer walls,
      against all the ships of Tarshish
      and all things of price...

      Human pride will be humbled,
      the arrogance of men will be brought low.
      The Lord alone will be exalted,
      on that day,
      and all idols thrown down.

      Go into the hollows of the rocks,
      into the caverns of the earth,
      at the sight of the terror of the Lord,
      at the brilliance of his majesty,
      when he arises
      to make the earth quake.

      That day man will fling to moles and bats the idols of silver and the idols of gold that he made for worship,

      and go into the crevices of the rocks
      and the rifts of the crag,
      at the sight of the terror of the Lord,
      at the brilliance of his majesty,
      when he arises
      to make the earth quake.

      Trust no more in man,
      he has but a breath in his nostrils.
      How much is he worth?

      That day, the branch of the Lord
      shall be beauty and glory,
      and the fruit of the earth
      shall be the pride and adornment
      of Israel's survivors.
      Those who are left of Zion
      and remain of Jerusalem
      shall be called holy
      and those left in Jerusalem, noted down for survival.

      When the Lord has washed away
      the filth of the daughter of Zion
      and cleansed Jerusalem of the blood shed in her
      with the blast of judgement and the blast of destruction,
      the Lord will come and rest
      on the whole stretch of Mount Zion
      and on those who are gathered there,
      a cloud by day, and smoke,
      and by night the brightness of a flaring fire.
      For, over all, the glory of the Lord
      will be a canopy and a tent
      to give shade by day from the heat,
      refuge and shelter from the storm and the rain.
    responsory:
      - ["The proud man will lower his eyes; the arrogant man will be humbled.","The Lord alone shall be exalted on that day."]
      - ["They will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with great power and majesty.","The Lord alone shall be exalted on that day."]

      From a sermon by Saint Gregory Nazianzen, bishop.

      The very Son of God, older than the ages, the invisible, the incomprehensible, the incorporeal, the beginning of beginning, the light of light, the fountain of life and immortality, the image of the archetype, the immovable seal, the perfect likeness, the definition and word of the Father: he it is who comes to his own image and takes our nature for the good of our nature, and unites himself to an intelligent soul for the good of my soul, to purify like by like. He takes to himself all that is human, except for sin. He was conceived by the Virgin Mary, who had been first prepared in soul and body by the Spirit; his coming to birth had to be treated with honour, virginity had to receive new honour. He comes forth as God, in the human nature he has taken, one being, made of two contrary elements, flesh and spirit. Spirit gave divinity, flesh received it.

      He who makes rich is made poor; he takes on the poverty of my flesh, that I may gain the riches of his divinity. He who is full is made empty; he is emptied for a brief space of his glory, that I may share in his fullness. What is this wealth of goodness? What is this mystery that surrounds me? I received the likeness of God, but failed to keep it. He takes on my flesh, to bring salvation to the image, immortality to the flesh. He enters into a second union with us, a union far more wonderful than the first.

      Holiness had to be brought to man by the humanity assumed by one who was God, so that God might overcome the tyrant by force and so deliver us and lead us back to himself through the mediation of his Son. The Son arranged this for the honour of the Father, to whom the Son is clearly obedient in all things.
      The Good Shepherd, who lays down his life for the sheep, came in search of the straying sheep to the mountains and hills on which you used to offer sacrifice. When he found it, he took it on the shoulders that bore the wood of the cross, and led it back to the life of heaven.

      Christ, the light of all lights, follows John, the lamp that goes before him. The Word of God follows the voice in the wilderness; the bridegroom follows the bridegroom's friend, who prepares a worthy people for the Lord by cleansing them by water in preparation for the Spirit.

      We need God to take our flesh and die, that we might live. We have died with him, that we may be purified. We have risen again with him, because we have died with him. We have been glorified with him, because we have risen again with him.
    responsory:
      - ["When at last the appointed time had come, God sent his Son into the world, born of a virgin, subject to the law.","To redeem those who were subject to the law."]
      - ["Because of his great love for us, God sent his Son in the likeness of our sinful human nature.","To redeem those who were subject to the law."]
