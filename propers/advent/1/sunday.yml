      From the beginning of the book of the prophet Isaiah.

      The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem, which he saw in the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

      Listen, you heavens; earth, attend
      for the Lord is speaking,
      'I reared sons, I brought them up,
      but they have rebelled against me.
      The ox knows its owner
      and the ass its master's crib,
      Israel knows nothing,
      my people understands nothing.'

      A sinful nation, a people weighed down with guilt,
      a breed of wrong-doers, perverted sons.
      They have abandoned the Lord, despised the Holy One of Israel,
      they have turned away from him.

      Where shall I strike you next,
      since you heap one betrayal on another?
      The whole head is sick, the whole heart grown faint;
      from the sole of the foot to the head there is not a sound spot:
      wounds, bruises, open sores
      not dressed, not bandaged,
      not soothed with oil.

      Your land is desolate, your towns burnt down,
      your fields-- strangers lay them waste before your eyes;
      all is desolation, as after the fall of Sodom.

      The daughter of Zion is left
      like a shanty in a vineyard,
      like a shed in a melon patch,
      like a besieged city.
      Had the Lord not left us a few survivors,
      we should be like Sodom,
      we should now be like Gomorrah.

      Hear the word of the Lord,
      you rulers of Sodom;
      listen to the command of our God,
      you people of Gomorrah.

      'What are your endless sacrifices to me?
      says the Lord.
      I am sick of holocausts of rams
      and the fat of calves.
      The blood of bulls and of goats revolts me.
      When you come to present yourselves before me,
      who asked you to trample over my courts?
      Bring me your worthless offerings no more,
      the smoke of them fills me with disgust.
      New Moons, sabbaths, assemblies--
      I cannot endure festival and solemnity.
      Your New Moons and your pilgrimages
      I hate with all my soul.
      They lie heavy on me,
      I am tired of bearing them.
      When you stretch out your hands
      I turn my eyes away.
      You may multiply your prayers,
      I shall not listen.
      Your hands are covered with blood,
      wash, make yourselves clean.

      'Take your wrong-doing out of my sight.
      Cease to do evil.
      Learn to do good,
      search for justice,
      help the oppressed,
      be just to the orphan,
      plead for the widow.

      'Come now, let us talk this over,
      says the Lord.
      Though your sins are like scarlet,
      they shall be as white as snow;
      though they are red as crimson,`
      they shall be like wool.'
    responsory:
      - ["Wash yourselves, be clean, banish evil from your hearts, away from my sight.","Though your sins be scarlet, they shall be made white as snow."]
      - ["Cease to do evil and learn to do good; seek always what is just.","Though your sins be scarlet, they shall be made white as snow."]

      From a catechetical instruction of Saint Cyril of Jerusalem, bishop.

      We do not preach only one coming of Christ, but a second as well, much more glorious than the first. The first coming was marked by patience; the second will bring the crown of a divine kingdom.

      In general, whatever relates to our Lord Jesus Christ has two aspects. There is a birth from God before the ages, and a birth from a virgin at the fullness of time. There is a hidden coming, like that of rain on fleece, and a coming before all eyes, still in the future.

      At the first coming he was wrapped in swaddling clothes in a manger. At his second coming he will be clothed in light as in a garment. In the first coming he endured the cross, despising the shame; in the second coming he will be in glory, escorted by an army of angels.

      We look then beyond the first coming and await the second. At the first coming we said: "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. "At the second we shall say it again; we shall go out with the angels to meet the Lord and cry out in adoration: "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord."

      The Saviour will not come to be judged again, but to judge those by whom he was judged. At his own judgement he was silent; then he will address those who committed the outrages against him when they crucified him and will remind them: "You did these things, and I was silent."

      His first coming was to fulfil his plan of love, to teach men by gentle persuasion. This time, whether men like it or not, they will be subjects of his kingdom by necessity.

      Malachi the prophet speaks of the two comings. "And the Lord whom you seek will come suddenly to his temple": that is one coming.

      Again he says of another coming: "Look, the Lord almighty will come, and who will endure the day of his entry, or who will stand in his sight? Because he comes like a refiner's fire, a fuller's herb, and he will sit refining and cleansing."

      These two comings are also referred to by Paul in writing to Titus: "The grace of God the Saviour has appeared to all men, instructing us to put aside impiety and worldly desires and live temperately, uprightly, and religiously in this present age, waiting for the joyful hope, the appearance of the glory of our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ." Notice how he speaks of a first coming for which he gives thanks, and a second, the one we still await.

      That is why the faith we profess has been handed on to you in these words: "He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father, and he will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end."

      Our Lord Jesus Christ will therefore come from heaven. He will come at the end of the world, in glory, at the last day. For there will be an end to this world, and the created world will be made new.
