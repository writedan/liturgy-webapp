      From the Acts of the Apostles.

      Barnabas took charge of Saul and brought him to the apostles, and he reported to them how on the way he had seen the Lord and that he had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus. He moved about freely with them in Jerusalem, and spoke out boldly in the name of the Lord. He also spoke and debated with the Hellenists, but they tried to kill him. And when the brothers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him on his way to Tarsus.

      The church throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria was at peace. It was being built up and walked in the fear of the Lord, and with the consolation of the holy Spirit it grew in numbers.

      Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that arose because of Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to no one but Jews. There were some Cypriots and Cyrenians among them, however, who came to Antioch and began to speak to the Greeks as well, proclaiming the Lord Jesus. The hand of the Lord was with them and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.

      The news about them reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to go to Antioch. When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain faithful to the Lord in firmness of heart, for he was a good man, filled with the holy Spirit and faith. And a large number of people was added to the Lord.

      Then he went to Tarsus to look for Saul, and when he had found him he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a large number of people, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.
    responsory:
      - ["The word of God continued to increase and spread everywhere.","And all who were destined for eternal life believed in it."]
      - ["The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.","And all who were destined for eternal life believed in it."]

      From a homily on the gospels by Saint Gregory the Great, pope.

      Beloved brothers, our Lord and Saviour sometimes gives us instruction by words and sometimes by actions. His very deeds are our commands; and whenever he acts silently he is teaching us what we should do. For example, he sends his disciples out to preach two by two, because the precept of charity is twofold-love of God and of one's neighbour.

      The Lord sends his disciples out to preach in two's in order to teach us silently that whoever fails in charity toward his neighbour should by no means take upon himself the office of preaching.

      Rightly is it said that "he sent them ahead of him into every city and place where he himself was to go." For the Lord follows after the preachers, because preaching goes ahead to prepare the way, and then when the words of exhortation have gone ahead and established truth in our minds, the Lord comes to live within us. To those who preach Isaiah says: "Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God." And the psalmist tells them: "Make a way for him who rises above the sunset." The Lord rises above the sunset because from that very place where he slept in death, he rose again and manifested a greater glory. He rises above the sunset because in his resurrection he trampled underfoot the death which he endured. Therefore, we make a way for him who rises above the sunset when we preach his glory to you, so that when he himself follows after us, he may illumine you with his love.

      Let us listen now to his words as he sends his preachers forth: "The harvest is great but the labourers are few. Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send labourers into his harvest." That the harvest is good but the labourers are few cannot be said without a heavy heart, for although there are many to hear the good news there are only a few to preach it. Indeed, see how full the world is of priests, but yet in God's harvest a true labourer is rarely to be found; although we have accepted the priestly office we do not fulfil its demands.

      Think over, my beloved brothers, think over his words: "Pray the Lord of the harvest to send labourers into his harvest." Pray for us so that we may be able to labour worthily on your behalf, that our tongue may not grow weary of exhortation, that after we have taken up the office of preaching our silence may not bring us condemnation from the just judge.
    responsory:
      - ["He carefully traced the whole story from the beginning and wrote his gospel.","So that we might understand the truth of the teaching we had received."]
      - ["He gave us a record concerning all that Jesus did and taught.","So that we might understand the truth of the teaching we had received."]
