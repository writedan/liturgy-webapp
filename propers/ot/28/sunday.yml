       We possess the prophetic message that is altogether reliable. You will do well to be attentive to it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. Know this first of all, that there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.

      From the beginning of the book of the prophet Haggai.

      On the first day of the sixth month in the second year of King Darius, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai to the governor of Judah, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and to the high priest Joshua, son of Jehozadak:

        Thus says the Lord of hosts: This people says: "Not now has the time come to rebuild the house of the Lord." Then this word of the Lord came through Haggai, the prophet:  Is it time for you to dwell in your own paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?
        
        Now thus says the Lord of hosts:
          Consider your ways!
        You have sown much, but have brought in little;
          you have eaten, but have not been satisfied;
        You have drunk, but have not been exhilarated;
          have clothed yourselves, but not been warmed;
        And he who earned wages
          earned them for a bag with holes in it.
        
            Thus says the Lord of hosts:
        Consider your ways! Go up into the hill country;
          bring timber, and build the house
        That I may take pleasure in it
          and receive my glory, says the Lord.
        You expected much, but it came to little;
          and what you brought home, I blew away.
        For what cause? says the Lord of hosts.
          Because my house lies in ruins,
          while each of you hurries to his own house.
        Therefore the heavens withheld from you their dew,
          and the earth her crops.
        And I called for a drought
          upon the land and upon the mountains;
        Upon the grain, and upon the wine, and upon the oil,
          and upon all that the ground brings forth;
        Upon men and upon beasts,
          and upon all that is produced by hand.  
        
        Then Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and the high priest Joshua, son of Jehozadak, and all the remnant of the people listened to the voice of the Lord, their God, and to the words of the prophet Haggai, because the Lord, their God, had sent him, and the people feared because of the Lord. And the Lord's messenger, Haggai, proclaimed to the people as the message of the Lord: I am with you, says the Lord.
        
        Then the Lord stirred up the spirit of the governor of Judah, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and the spirit of the high priest Joshua, son of Jehozadak, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people, so that they came and set to work on the house of the Lord of hosts, their God, on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month.
        
        In the second year of King Darius, on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai: Tell this to the governor of Judah, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and to the high priest Joshua, son of Jehozadak, and to the remnant of the people:
        
        Who is left among you
          that saw this house in its former glory?
        And how do you see it now?
          Does it not seem like nothing in your eyes?
        
        But now take courage, Zerubbabel, says the Lord,
          and take courage, Joshua, high priest, son of Jehozadak,
        And take courage, all you people of the land,
          says the Lord, and work!
          For I am with you, says the Lord of hosts.
        This is the pact that I made with you
          when you came out of Egypt,
        And my spirit continues in your midst;
          do not fear!  
        
            For thus says the Lord of hosts:
        One moment yet, a little while,
          and I will shake the heavens and the earth,
          the sea and the dry land.
        I will shake all the nations,
          and the treasures of all the nations will come in,
        And I will fill this house with glory,
          says the Lord of hosts.
        Mine is the silver and mine the gold,
          says the Lord of hosts.
        Greater will be the future glory of this house
          than the former, says the Lord of hosts;
        And in this place I will give you peace,
          says the Lord of hosts!

      From a commentary on Haggai of Saint Cyril of Alexandria, bishop.

        When our Savior came, he appeared as a divine temple, glorious beyond any comparison, far more splendid and excellent than the older temple. He exceeded the old as much as worship in Christ and the gospels exceeds the cult of the laws, as much as truth exceeds its shadows.
        
        Furthermore, I might point out that originally there was just one temple at Jerusalem, in which one people, the Israelites, offered their sacrifices. Since the only-begotten Son became like us, and as Scripture says, though he was Lord and God, he has shone upon us, the rest of the world has been filled with places of worship.
        
        Now there are countless worshipers who honor the universal God with spiritual offerings and fragrant sacrifices. This surely, is what Malachi foretold, speaking, as if in the person of God: I am a great king, says the Lord; my name is honored among the nations, and everywhere there is offered to my name the fragrance of a pure sacrifice.
        
        With justice, therefore, do we say that the final temple, the Church, will be more glorious. To those who are so solicitous for the Church and labor for its construction, Haggai declares that a gift will be made, a gift from heaven given by the Savior. That gift is Christ himself, the peace of all men: through him we have access in the one Spirit to the Father. The prophet goes on to say: I will give peace to this place and peace of soul to save all who lay the foundation to rebuild the temple. Christ too says somewhere: My peace I give you. Paul will teach how profitable this is for those who love: The peace of Christ, he says, which surpasses all understanding will keep your minds and hearts. Isaiah, the seer, made the same prayer: O Lord our God, give us peace, for you have given us everything. Once a man has been found worthy of Christ's peace, he can easily save his soul and guide his mind to carry out exactingly the demands of virtue.
        
        Haggai, therefore, declares that peace will be given to all who build. One builds the Church either as a teacher of the sacred mysteries, as one set over the house of God, or as one who works for his own good by setting himself forth as a living and spiritual stone in the holy temple, God's dwelling place in the Spirit. The results of these efforts will profit such men so that each will be able to gain his own salvation without difficulty.

    text: "Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David: such is my gospel. This saying is trustworthy: If we have died with him we shall also live with him; if we persevere we shall also reign with him. But if we deny him he will deny us. If we are unfaithful he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself."
  benedictus: "You have left everything to follow me; you will have it all returned a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life."
