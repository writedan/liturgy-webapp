      From the book of the prophet Haggai.

      On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of King Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Haggai:

      Thus says the Lord of hosts: Ask the priests for a decision: If a man carries sanctified flesh in the fold of his garment and the fold touches bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any other food, do they become sanctified? "No," the priests answered.

      Then Haggai said: If a person unclean from contact with a corpse touches any of these, do they become unclean? The priests answered, "They become unclean."  Then Haggai continued:

      So is this people, and so is this nation
        in my sight, says the Lord:
      And so are all the works of their hands;
        and what they offer there is unclean.

      But now, consider from this day forward. Before there was a stone laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord,how did you fare?

      When one went to a heap of grain for twenty measures,
        it would yield but ten;
      When another went to the vat to draw fifty measures,
        there would be but twenty.
      I struck you in all the works of your hands
        with blight, searing wind, and hail,
        yet you did not return to me, says the Lord.

      (Consider from this day forward: from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. From the day on which the temple of the Lord was founded, consider!)

      Indeed, the seed has not sprouted,
        nor have the vine, the fig, the pomegranate
        and the olive tree yet borne.
      From this day, I will bless!

      The message of the Lord came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month:Tell this to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah:

      I will shake the heavens and the earth;
        I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms,
        destroy the power of the kingdoms of the nations.
      I will overthrow the chariots and their riders,
        and the riders with their horses
        shall go down by one another's sword.
          On that day, says the Lord of hosts,
      I will take you, Zerubbabel,
        son of Shealtiel, my servant, says the Lord,
      And I will set you as a signet ring;
        for I have chosen you, says the Lord of hosts.
    responsory:
      - ["I will shake the heavens and the earth.","And the treasures of all nations will come in."]
      - ["The glory of this house will be great; I will give peace to this place.","And the treasures of all nations will come in."]

      From a treatise against Fabianus by Fulgentius of Ruspe, bishop.

      In our offering of the holy sacrifice we fulfill the command of our Savior, as recorded by the apostle Paul: The "Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and after he had given thanks, broke it and said: This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me. In the same way after the supper, he took the cup saying: This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you shall proclaim the death of the Lord until he comes."

      This sacrifice is offered, then, to proclaim the Lord's death: it is offered in remembrance of him who laid down his life for our sake. As he says: "Greater love than this no one has, that one lay down his life for his friends." Because Christ died for us out of love, we ask, when we make remembrance of his death at the time of sacrifice, that we too may be granted love through the coming of the Holy Spirit. We pray that by the love which Christ had for us when he braved the cross, we may receive the grace of the Spirit and be crucified to the world, and the world to us. "The death Christ died, he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives, he lives to God." Let us imitate our Lord's death, and also live a new life. Strengthened with the gift of his love, let us die to sin and live for God.

      "For God's love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us." Indeed our sharing in the Lord's body and blood when we eat his bread and drink his cup teaches us that we should die to the world, and that we should keep our "life hidden with Christ in God, crucifying our flesh with its vices and evil desires."

      That is why all the faithful who love God and their neighbor truly drink the cup of the Lord's love even though they may not drink the cup of his bodily suffering. And becoming inebriated from it, they put to death whatever in their nature is rooted in earth. They clothe themselves with the Lord Jesus Christ and do not indulge fleshly desires. They do not fix their gaze on visible things, but contemplate things which the eye cannot see. Thus they drink the Lord's cup by preserving the holy bond of love; without it, even if a man should deliver "his body to be burned," he gains nothing. But the gift of love enables us to become in reality what we celebrate as mystery in the sacrifice. 
    responsory:
      - ["Jesus took bread, gave thanks, and broke the bread: then he gave it to his disciples and said:","This is my body which is given up for you. Do this in memory of me."]
      - ["This is the bread come down from heaven; anyone who eats this bread will live forever.","This is my body which is given up for you. Do this in memory of me."]
