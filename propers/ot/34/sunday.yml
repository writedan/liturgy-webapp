      God raised Christ from the dead and seated him at his right hand in heaven, high above every principality, power, virtue and domination, and every name that can be given in this age or in the age to come. He has put all things under Christ's feet and has made him, thus exalted, head of the church, which is his body: the fullness of him who fills the universe in all its parts.

      From the book of Revelation.

      Grace and peace to you from him who is, who was, and who is to come, from the seven spirits in his presence before his throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the First-born from the dead, the Ruler of the kings of the earth. He loves us and has washed away our sins with his blood, and made us a line of kings, priests to serve his God and Father; to him, then, be glory and power for ever and ever. Amen.

      It was the Lord’s day and the Spirit possessed me, and I heard a voice behind me, shouting like a trumpet, I turned round to see who had spoken to me, and when I turned I saw seven golden lamp-stands and, surrounded by them, a figure like a Son of man, dressed in a long robe tied at the waist with a golden girdle. His head and his hair were white as white wool or as snow, his eyes like a burning flame, his feet like burnished bronze when it has been refined in a furnace, and his voice like the sound of the ocean. In his right hand he was holding seven stars, out of his mouth came a sharp sword, double-edged, and his face was like the sun shining with all its force.

      When I saw him, I fell in a dead faint at his feet, but he touched me with his right hand and said, "Do not be afraid; it is I, the First and the Last; I am the Living One, I was dead and now I am to live for ever and ever, and I hold the keys of death and of the underworld.

      "To those who prove victorious, and keep working for me until the end, which I myself have been given by my Father, to rule them with an iron sceptre and shatter them like earthenware. And I will give him the Morning Star. I shall not blot their names out of the book of life, but acknowledge their names in the presence of my Father and his angels.

      "Those who prove victorious I will make into pillars in the sanctuary of my God, and they will stay there for ever; I will inscribe on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God the new Jerusalem which comes down from my God in heaven, and my own new name as well.

      "Look, I am standing at the door, knocking. If one of you hears me calling and opens the door, I will come in to share his meal, side by side with him. Those who prove victorious I will allow to share my throne, just as I was victorious myself and took my place with my Father on his throne."
    responsory:
      - ["They will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with great power and majesty; then he will send out the angels.","And he will gather his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the farthest bounds of heaven."]
      - ["He will judge the world with justice and the peoples with truth.","And he will gather his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the farthest bounds of heaven."]

      From a notebook on prayer by Origen, priest.

      "The kingdom of God," in the words of our Lord and Savior, "does not come for all to see; nor shall they say: Behold, here it is, or behold, there it is; but the kingdom of God is within us, for the word of God is very near, in our mouth and in our heart." Thus it is clear that he who prays for the coming of God’s kingdom prays rightly to have it within himself, that there it might grow and bear fruit and become perfect. For God reigns in each of his holy ones. Anyone who is holy obeys the spiritual laws of God, who dwells in him as in a well-ordered city. The Father is present in the perfect soul, and with him Christ reigns, according to the words: "We shall come to him and make our home with him."

      Thus the kingdom of God within us, as we continue to make progress, will reach its highest point when the Apostle’s words are fulfilled, and Christ, having subjected all his enemies to himself, will hand over "his kingdom to God the Father, that God may be all in all." Therefore, let us pray unceasingly with that disposition of soul which the Word may make divine, saying to our Father who is in heaven: "Hallowed be your name; your kingdom come."

      Note this too about the kingdom of God. It is not "a sharing of justice with iniquity, nor a society of light with darkness, nor a meeting of Christ with Belial." The kingdom of God cannot exist alongside the reign of sin.

      Therefore, if we wish God to reign in us, in no way "should sin reign in our mortal body; rather we should mortify our members which are upon the earth and bear fruit in the Spirit." There should be in us a kind of spiritual paradise where God may walk and be our sole ruler with his Christ. In us the Lord will sit at the right hand of that spiritual power which we wish to receive. And he will sit there until all his enemies who are within us become his footstool, and every principality, power and virtue in us is cast out.

      All this can happen in each one of us, and the last enemy, death, can be destroyed; then Christ will say in us: "O death, where is your sting? O hell, where is your victory?" And so what is corruptible in us must be clothed with holiness and incorruptibility; death will be cast out, and our mortality will be clad with the Father’s immortality, so that, as God reigns in us, we may truly enjoy the blessings of rebirth and resurrection.

      - ["The kingdom of this world belongs to our Lord and his Christ.","And he shall reign forever and ever."]
      - ["All the families of nations shall bow down before him, for the Lord is our king.","And he shall reign forever and ever."]

      For Christ must reign until God has put all his enemies under his feet, and the last enemy to be destroyed is death.  Scripture reads that God "has placed all things under his feet."  But when it says that everything has been made subject, it is clear that he who has made everything subject to Christ is excluded.  When, finally, all has been subjected to the Son, he will then subject himself to the One who made all things subject to him, so that God may be all in all.
