      From the second letter of Saint Peter the Apostle.

      I will always remind you of these things, even though you already know them and are established in the truth you have. I think it right, as long as I am in this "tent,"  to stir you up by a reminder, since I know that I will soon have to put it aside, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me. I shall also make every effort to enable you always to remember these things after my departure.

      We did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming  of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received honor and glory from God the Father  when that unique declaration came to him from the majestic glory, "This is my Son, my beloved, with whom I am well pleased." We  ourselves heard this voice come from heaven while we were with him on the holy mountain.

      Moreover, we possess the prophetic message that is altogether reliable. You will do well to be attentive to it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.  

      Know this first of all, that there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God. 
    responsory:
      - ["The Word became flesh and lived among us.","And we have seen his glory: the glory of the Father's only Son."]
      - ["We witnessed with our own eyes his sovereign majesty when we were with him on the holy mountain.","And we have seen his glory: the glory of the Father's only Son."]

      From a treatise on John by Saint Augustine, bishop.

      We Christians are the light, at least by comparison with unbelievers. Thus the Apostle says: "For once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk then as sons of the light. And elsewhere he says: The night is far spent, the day is drawing near. Let us therefore lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light; let us walk uprightly as in the day."

      Nevertheless, since the days in which we are now living are still dark compared to the light which we shall see, hear what the apostle Peter says. He speaks of a voice that came from the Supreme Glory and said to the Lord Christ: "You are my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased." This voice, he says, "we heard coming from heaven, when we were with him on the holy mountain." Because we ourselves were not present there and did not hear the voice from heaven, Peter says to us: "And we possess a more certain prophetic word to which you do well to attend, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts."

      When, therefore, our Lord Jesus Christ shall come and, as the apostle says, bring to light things hidden in darkness and make plain the secrets of the heart, so that everyone may receive his commendation from God, then lamps will no longer be needed. When that day is at hand, the prophet will not be read to us, the book of the Apostle will not be opened, we shall not require the testimony of John, we shall have no need of the Gospel itself. Therefore all Scriptures will be taken away from us, those Scriptures which in the night of this world burned like lamps so that we might not remain in darkness.

      When all these things are removed as no longer necessary for our illumination, and when the men of God by whom they were ministered to us shall themselves together with us behold the true and dear light without such aids, what shall we see? With what shall our minds be nourished? What will give joy to our gaze? Where will that gladness come from which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, which has not even been conceived by the heart of man? What shall we see?

      I implore you to live with me and, by believing, to run with me; let us long for our heavenly country, let us sigh for our heavenly home, let us truly feel that here we are strangers. What shall we then see? Let the gospel tell us: "In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God." You will come to the fountain, with whose dew you have already been sprinkled. Instead of the ray of light which was sent through slanting and winding ways into the heart of your darkness, you will see the light itself in all its purity and brightness. It is to see and experience this light that you are now being cleansed. "Dearly beloved," John himself says, "we are the sons of God, and it has not yet been disclosed what we shall be; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is."

      I feel that your spirits are being raised up with mine to the heavens above; but the body which is corruptible weighs down the soul, and this earthly tent burdens the thoughtful mind. I am about to lay aside this book, and you are soon going away, each to his own business. It has been good for us to share the common light, good to have enjoyed ourselves, good to have been glad together. When we part from one another, let us not depart from him.
    responsory:
    - ["Night will be no more, nor will they need the light of the lamp or the sun.","For the Lord God will be their light, and they shall reign forever."]
    - ["They shall see him face to face and bear his name on their foreheads.","For the Lord God will be their light, and they shall reign forever."]
