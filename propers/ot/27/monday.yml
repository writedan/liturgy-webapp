      From the first letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to Timothy.

      First of all, then, I ask that supplications, prayers, petitions, and thanksgivings be offered for everyone, for kings and for all in authority, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all devotion and dignity.

      This is good and pleasing to God our savior, who wills everyone to be saved and to come to knowledge of the truth.

      For there is one God. There is also one mediator between God and the human race, Christ Jesus, himself human, who gave himself as ransom for all.

      This was the testimony at the proper time. For this I was appointed preacher and apostle I am speaking the truth, I am not lying , teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.

      It is my wish, then, that in every place the men should pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger or argument.

      Similarly, too, women should adorn themselves with proper conduct, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hairstyles and gold ornaments, or pearls, or expensive clothes, but rather, as befits women who profess reverence for God, with good deeds. A woman must receive instruction silently and under complete control. I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man. She must be quiet.

      For Adam was formed first, then Eve. Further, Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and transgressed. But she will be saved through motherhood, provided women persevere in faith and love and holiness, with self-control.
    responsory:
      - ["There is only one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.","He gave himself as a ransom for all."]
      - ["He had to become like his brothers in every way, so that he might show them compassion.","He gave himself as a ransom for all."]

      From a treatise on Cain and Abel of Saint Ambrose, bishop.

      "Offer God a sacrifice of praise and fulfill your vows to the Most High." If you praise God you offer your vow and fulfill the promise you have made. So the Samaritan leper, healed by the Lord's word of command, gained greater credit than the other nine; he alone returned to Christ, praising God and giving thanks. Jesus said of him: "There was no one to come back and thank God except this foreigner." He tells him: "Stand up and go on your way, for your faith has made you whole."

      The Lord Jesus, in his divine wisdom, taught you about the goodness of the Father, who knows how to give good things, so that you might ask for the things that are good from Goodness itself. He urges you to pray earnestly and frequently, not offering long and wearisome prayers, but praying often, and with perseverance. Lengthy prayers are usually filled with empty words, while neglect of prayer results in indifference to prayer.

      Again, Christ urges you, when you ask forgiveness for yourself, to be especially generous to others, so that your actions may commend your prayer. The Apostle, too, teaches you how to pray; you must avoid anger and contentiousness, so that your prayer may be serene and wholesome. He tells you also that every place is a place of prayer, though our Savior says: "Go into your room."

      But by "room" you must understand, not a room enclosed by walls that imprison your body, but the room that is within you, the room where you hide your thoughts, where you keep your affections. This room of prayer is always with you, wherever you are, and it is always a secret room, where only God can see you.

      You are told to pray especially for the people, that is, for the whole body, for all its members, the family of your mother the Church; the badge of membership in this body is love for each other. If you pray only for yourself, you pray for yourself alone. If each one prays for himself, he received less from God's goodness than the one who prays on behalf of others. But as it is, because each prays for all, all are in fact praying for each one.

      To conclude, if you pray only for yourself, you will be praying, as we said, for yourself alone. But if you pray for all, all will pray for you, for you are included in all. In this way there is a great recompense; through the prayers of each individual, the intercession of the whole people is gained for each individual. There is here no pride, but an increase of humility and a richer harvest from prayer.
    responsory:
      - ["Hear, O God, my cry for help; listen to my prayer.","From the ends of the earth I call to you."]
      - ["You, my God, have received my vows and given me the heritage of those who fear your name.","From the ends of the earth I call to you."]
