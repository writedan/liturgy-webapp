      From a letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Philipians.

      Only, conduct yourselves in a way worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear news of you, that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind struggling together for the faith of the gospel,not intimidated in any way by your opponents. This is proof to them of destruction, but of your salvation. And this is God's doing.For to you has been granted, for the sake of Christ, not only to believe in him but also to suffer for him.Yours is the same struggle as you saw in me and now hear about me.

      If there is any encouragement in Christ, any solace in love, any participation in the Spirit, any compassion and mercy,complete my joy by being of the same mind, with the same love, united in heart, thinking one thing.Do nothing out of selfishness or out of vainglory; rather, humbly regard others as more important than yourselves,each looking out not for his own interests, but (also) everyone for those of others.Have among yourselves the same attitude that is also yours in Christ Jesus,

      Who, though he was in the form of God,
       did not regard equality with God
       something to be grasped.
      Rather, he emptied himself,
       taking the form of a slave,
       coming in human likeness;
       and found human in appearance,
       he humbled himself,
       becoming obedient to death,
       even death on a cross.
      Because of this,
       God greatly exalted him
       and bestowed on him the name
       that is above every name,
       that at the name of Jesus
       every knee should bend,
       of those in heaven and on earth
       and under the earth,
       and every tongue confess
       that Jesus Christ is Lord,
       to the glory of God the Father.
    responsory:
      - ["Christ bore our sins on the cross so that we might die to sin and live a life of holiness.","Through his death he broke the power of the devil, the prince of death."]
      - ["Our faith rests on Jesus, who endured the cross for the sake of the joy that lay before him.","Through his death he broke the power of the devil, the prince of death."]

      From a letter of Saint Polycarp, bishop and martyr, to the Philippians.

      Presbyters should be sympathetic and merciful to everyone, bring back those who have wandered, visiting the sick; they must not neglect widows and orphans, or the poor, "ever providing for what is good in the sight of God and of men." They should refrain entirely from anger, human respect and prejudice; avarice should be wholly alien to them. Nor should they be rash in believing something said against another, nor too severe in judging others, since they know that we are all debtors through sin.

      If, then, we pray to the Lord to forgive us, we must in turn forgive. For we live under the eye of our Lord and God, and "we must all stand before the judgment seat of God, each to give an account of himself." Let us then serve God with fear and awe. The Lord's command is also the command of the apostles who preached the Gospel to us, to say nothing of the prophets who foretold the Lord's coming. Our observance of what is good should be meticulous, avoiding anything that might cause another to stumble; we must shun false brothers and those who assume the Lord's name hypocritically and lead the unwary into error.

      "For anyone who does not confess that Jesus has come in the flesh is the antichrist." And anyone who refuses to admit the testimony of the cross is of the devil. Whoever perverts the Lord's words to suit his own desires and denies that there is a resurrection or a judgment is the firstborn of Satan. So let us abandon the folly of the masses and their false teaching, and return to the teaching that was handed down to us from the beginning. We must be alert in prayer, constant in fasting; and in our prayers let us beg God, who sees everything, "not to lead us into temptation." As the Lord has said: "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."

      So let us persevere in the pledge of our righteousness and in our hope, that is, in Christ Jesus. "In his mouth no hint of guilt was discovered; he committed no sin and yet bore our sins in his own body on the tree." Rather, he endured everything for our sake so that we might live in him. Let us then imitate his constancy; if we should suffer because of his name, let us give him that glory. For this is the personal example he has given us, this is the object of our faith.
    responsory:
      - ["We should be concerned with living honorable lives, not only in the sight of God but in the sight of all men.","Let us never give offense to anyone so that our ministry may not be blamed."]
      - ["I trust in God and I strive to keep a clear conscience before God and man.","Let us never give offense to anyone so that our ministry may not be blamed."]
