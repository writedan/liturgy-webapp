      From the letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Philippians.

      So then, my beloved, obedient as you have always been, not only when I am present but all the more now when I am absent, work out your salvation with fear and trembling. For God is the one who, for his good purpose, works in you both to desire and to work.

      Do everything without grumbling or questioning, that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation,  among whom you shine like lights in the world, as you hold on to the word of life, so that my boast for the day of Christ may be that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. But, even if I am poured out as a libation  upon the sacrificial service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with all of you. In the same way you also should rejoice and share your joy with me.

      I hope, in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy  to you soon, so that I too may be heartened by hearing news of you. For I have no one comparable to him for genuine interest in whatever concerns you. For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.

      But you know his worth, how as a child with a father he served along with me in the cause of the gospel. He it is, then, whom I hope to send as soon as I see how things go with me, but I am confident in the Lord that I myself will also come soon.

      With regard to Epaphroditus,  my brother and co-worker and fellow soldier, your messenger and minister in my need, I consider it necessary to send him to you. For he has been longing for all of you and was distressed because you heard that he was ill. He was indeed ill, close to death; but God had mercy on him, not just on him but also on me, so that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow. I send him therefore with the greater eagerness, so that, on seeing him, you may rejoice again, and I may have less anxiety. Welcome him then in the Lord with all joy and hold such people in esteem, because for the sake of the work of Christ he came close to death, risking his life to make up for those services to me that you could not perform.

      From a letter of Saint Polycarp, bishop and martyr, to the Philippians.

      I ask you all to respond to the call of righteousness and to practice boundless patience. your own eyes have seen it not only in blessed Ignatius, Zosimus and Rufus, but in others from among you as well, to say nothing of Paul and the other apostles. Be assured that all these men "did not run their race in vain". No, they ran it in faith and in righteousness and are now with the Lord in the place that they have earned, even as they were once with him in suffering. "Their love was not for this present world"; rather, it was for him who died for our sakes and, on account of us, was raised up again by God.

      Be steadfast, then, and follow the Lord’s example, strong and unshaken in faith, loving the community as you love one another. United in the truth, show the Lord’s own gentleness in your dealings with one another, and look down on no one. If you can do good, do not put it off, because "almsgiving frees one from death." Be subject to one another, and "make sure that your behavior among the pagans is beyond reproach." Thus you will be praised for the good you have done, and the Lord will not be blasphemed because of you. "But woe to that man on whose account the Lord’s name is blasphemed." Therefore, teach everyone to live soberly, just as you live yourselves.

      I am greatly saddened on account of Valens who at one time was presbyter among you; he does not understand the position to which he was called. So I urge all of you to be chaste and honest, to avoid avarice and to refrain from every form of evil. If a man cannot control himself in these ways, how can he teach someone else to do so? If he does not avoid greed, he will be defiled by idolatrous practices and will be reckoned as one of the pagans who know nothing of the Lord’s judgment. Or, as Paul teaches: "Do we not know that the holy ones will judge the world?"

      However, I have never seen of heard of anything of that sort among you, for whom blessed Paul labored and whom he commends at the beginning of his letter. For he boasted about you in all the churches which at that time were the only ones that had come to know God, we ourselves had not yet come to that knowledge.

      Brothers, I am deeply sorry for Valens and for his wife; may the Lord grant them true repentance. As for yourselves, be self-controlled in this respect. "Do not look upon such people as enemies," but invite them back as frail members who have gone astray, so that the entire body of which you are a part will be saved. In doing this you are contributing to your own spiritual development.
    responsory:
      - ["In fear and trembling work out your salvation.","It is God who is working in you so that you both will and do according to his own good purpose."]
      - ["The Lord says: Without me you can do nothing.","It is God who is working in you so that you both will and do according to his own good purpose."]
