    O God, by whom we are redeemed and receive adoption,
    look graciously upon your beloved sons and daughters,
    that those who believe in Christ
    may receive true freedom
    and an everlasting inheritance:
    through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    God, for ever and ever.

            From the book of Lamentations.
            
            Remember, O Lord, what has befallen us,
              look, and see our disgrace:
            Our inherited lands have been turned over to strangers,
              our homes to foreigners.
            We have become orphans, fatherless;
              widowed are our mothers.

            The water we drink we must buy,
              for our own wood we must pay.
            On our necks is the yoke of those who drive us;
              we are worn out, but allowed no rest.
            To Egypt we submitted,
              and to Assyria, to fill our need of bread.

            Our fathers, who sinned, are no more;
              but we bear their guilt.
            Slaves rule over us;
              there is no one to rescue us from their hands.
            At the peril of our lives we bring in our sustenance,
              in the face of the desert heat;
            Our skin is shriveled up, as though by a furnace,
              with the searing blasts of famine.

            The wives in Zion were ravished by the enemy,
              the maidens in the cities of Judah;
            Princes were gibbeted by them,
              elders shown no respect.
            The youths carry the millstones,
              boys stagger under their loads of wood;
            The old men have abandoned the gate,
              the young men their music.

            The joy of our hearts has ceased,
              our dance has turned into mourning;
            The garlands have fallen from our heads:
              woe to us, for we have sinned!
            Over this our hearts are sick,
              at this our eyes grow dim:
            That Mount Zion should be desolate,
              with jackals roaming there!

            You, O Lord, are enthroned forever;
              your throne stands from age to age.
            Why, then, should you forget us,
              abandon us so long a time?
            Lead us back to you, O Lord, that we may be restored:
              give us anew such days as we had of old.
            For now you have indeed rejected us,
              and in full measure turned your wrath against us. 
        responsory:
            - ["You are enthroned forever, O Lord; why then, should you forget us forever?","Lead us back to you, and we shall be saved."]
            - ["Save us, Lord, or we shall perish.","Lead us back to you, and we shall be saved."]

            God, the Word of the all-good Father, did not disregard the human race, his own creation, when it was sinking back into corruption, but rather by the offering of his own body he destroyed the death men had incurred, and by his teaching he corrected their negligence. So he restored by his power all that belongs to man's estate.

            Anyone can find confirmation of this from the Savior's own disciples who spoke of him, for in their writings one reads: "The charity of Christ constrains us as we judge that if one died on behalf of all, then all died; and he died for all in order that we may live no longer for ourselves but for him who died for us and rose from the dead," our Lord Jesus Christ. And again: "We see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, that by God's grace he might taste death for everyone." Then the writer goes on to show why it had to be God the Word and no other who became man: "Indeed it was fitting that in bringing many sons to glory, God, for whom and through whom all things exist, should make perfect the one who leads them to salvation." By this he means that the task of bringing men back from the corruption into which they had fallen belonged to no other save God the Word who had made them in the beginning. Further, Scripture shows that the Word assumed a body for the purpose of offering it in sacrifice on behalf of other bodies like his own, for the writer continues: "Since the children have blood and flesh in common, he likewise shared in them himself so that by his own death he might destroy the one who had power over death, that is, the devil, and might deliver those who all their life long were enslaved by fear of death."

            For by the sacrifice of his own body he both put an end to the law that stood against us and made a new beginning of life for us by giving us the hope of resurrection. Hence Paul, the Christ-bearer, declares: "As through a man came death, so through a man has come the resurrection of the dead. For as all died in Adam, so also in Christ all shall be made to live."

            No longer, then, do we die as men condemned, but as men being raised even now, we await the general resurrection of all, which God, whose work and gift it is, "will reveal at the appointed time."
        responsory:
            - ["Everyone has sinned and is deprived of God's glory; we are justified through the free gift of his grace and through the redemption in Christ Jesus.","God made Christ's sacrificial death the means of expiating the sins of all believers."]
            - ["Just as in Adam all men die, so in Christ all men will be brought to life.","God made Christ's sacrificial death the means of expiating the sins of all believers."]

             Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, with the same love, united in heart, thinking one thing. Do nothing out of selfishness or out of vainglory; rather, humbly regard others as more important than yourselves, each looking out not for his own interests, but also everyone for those of others. Do everything without grumbling or questioning, that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine like lights in the world, as you hold on to the word of life, so that my boast for the day of Christ may be that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.
