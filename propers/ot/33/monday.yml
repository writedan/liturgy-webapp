      From the book of the prophet Joel.

      Thus says the Lord:
      Yes, in those days, and at that time,
        when I would restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
      I will assemble all the nations
        and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
      And I will enter into judgment with them there
        on behalf of my people and my inheritance, Israel;
      Because they have scattered them among the nations,
        and divided my land.
      Over my people they have cast lots;
        they gave a boy for a harlot,
        and sold a girl for the wine they drank.
      Declare this among the nations:
        proclaim a war,
        rouse the warriors to arms!
      Let all the soldiers
        report and march!
      Beat your plowshares into swords,
        and your pruning hooks into spears;
        let the weak man say, "I am a warrior!"
      Hasten and come, all you neighboring peoples,
        assemble there!
        Bring down, O Lord, your warriors!

      Let the nations bestir themselves and come up
        to the Valley of Jehoshaphat;
      For there I will sit in judgment
        upon all the neighboring nations.
      Apply the sickle,
        for the harvest is ripe;
      Come and tread,
        for the wine press is full;
      The vats overflow,
        for great is their malice.
      Crowd upon crowd
        in the valley of decision;
      For near is the day of the Lord
        in the valley of decision.

      Sun and moon are darkened,
        and the stars withhold their brightness.
      The Lord roars from Zion,
        and from Jerusalem raises his voice;
      The heavens and the earth quake,
        but the Lord is a refuge to his people,
        a stronghold to the men of Israel.
      Then shall you know that I, the Lord, am your God,
        dwelling on Zion, my holy mountain;
      Jerusalem shall be holy,
        and strangers shall pass through her no more.

      And then, on that day,
        the mountains shall drip new wine,
        and the hills shall flow with milk;
      And the channels of Judah
        shall flow with water:
      A fountain shall issue from the house of the Lord,
        to water the Valley of Shittim.
      Egypt shall be a waste,
        and Edom a desert waste,
      Because of violence done to the people of Judah,
        because they shed innocent blood in their land.
      But Judah shall abide forever,
        and Jerusalem for all generations.
      I will avenge their blood,
        and not leave it unpunished.
      The Lord dwells in Zion.
    responsory:
      - ["The mountains shall run with sweet wine, and all the riverbeds of Judah shall flow with water; a fountain shall spring from the house of the Lord.","If anyone is thirsty, come forward and receive the water of life, freely given to all who desire it."]
      - ["The angel showed me the river and water of life, bright as crystal, which flowed from the throne of God and of the Lamb.","If anyone is thirsty, come forward and receive the water of life, freely given to all who desire it."]

      From a treatise on forgiveness by Fulgentius of Ruspe, bishop.

      "In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye as the final trumpet sounds, for the trumpet shall indeed sound, the dead shall rise incorruptible and we shall be changed." In saying “we” Paul is indicating that the gift of that future change will also be given to those who during their time on earth are united to him and his companions by upright lives within the communion of the Church. He hints at the nature of the change when he says: "This corruptible body must put on incorruptibility, this mortal body immortality." In order, then, that men may obtain the transformation which is the reward of the just, they must first undergo here on earth a change which is God’s free gift. Those who in this life have been changed from evil to good are promised that future change as a reward.

      Through justification and the spiritual resurrection, grace now effects in them an initial change that is God’s gift. Later on, through the bodily resurrection, the transformation of the just will be brought to completion, and they will experience a perfect, abiding, unchangeable glorification. The purpose of this change wrought in them by the gifts of both justification and glorification is that they may abide in an eternal, changeless state of joy.

      Here on earth they are changed by the first resurrection, in which they are enlightened and converted, thus passing from death to life, sinfulness to holiness, unbelief to faith, and evil actions to holy life. For this reason the second death has no power over them. It is of such men that the Book of Revelation says: "Happy the man who shares in the first resurrection; over such as he the second death has no power." Elsewhere the same book says: "He who overcomes shall not be harmed by the second death." As the first resurrection consists of the conversion of the heart, the second death consists of unending torment.

      Let everyone, therefore, who does not wish to be condemned to the endless punishment of the second death now hasten to share in the first resurrection. For if any during this life are changed out of fear of God and pass from an evil life to a good one, they pass from death to life and later they shall be transformed from a shameful state to a glorious one.
    responsory:
      - ["You have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.","When Christ who is your life appears, you will appear with him in glory."]
      - ["You must consider yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord.","When Christ who is your life appears, you will appear with him in glory."]
