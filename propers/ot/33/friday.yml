      From the book of the prophet Zechariah.

      On that day I will seek the destruction of all nations that come against Jerusalem.  

      I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and petition; and they shall look on him whom they have thrust through, and they shall mourn for him as one mourns for an only son, and they shall grieve over him as one grieves over a first-born.  

      On that day the mourning in Jerusalem shall be as great as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. And the land shall mourn, each family apart.

      On that day there shall be open to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, a fountain to purify from sin and uncleanness. On that day, says the Lord of hosts, I will destroy the names of the idols from the land, so that they shall be mentioned no more; I will also take away the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness from the land. If a man still prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall say to him, "You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of the Lord." When he prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall thrust him through.  

      On that day, every prophet shall be ashamed to prophesy his vision, neither shall he assume the hairy mantle to mislead, but he shall say, "I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the soil, for I have owned land since my youth."  And if anyone asks him, "What are these wounds on your chest?" he shall answer, "With these I was wounded in the house of my dear ones."  

      Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, 
        against the man who is my associate, 
        says the Lord of hosts. 
      Strike the shepherd 
        that the sheep may be dispersed, 
        and I will turn my hand against the little ones. 
      In all the land, says the Lord, 
        two thirds of them shall be cut off and perish, 
        and one third shall be left. 
      I will bring the one third through fire, 
        and I will refine them as silver is refined, 
        and I will test them as gold is tested. 
      They shall call upon my name, 
        and I will hear them. 
      I will say, "They are my people," 
        and they shall say, "The Lord is my God." 
    responsory:
      - ["Tonight your faith in me will be shaken, for Scripture says:","I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered."]
      - ["Awake, O sword, and strike my shepherd, the man who is my companion, says the Lord.","I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered."]

      From a treatise on the kingdom of Jesus by Saint John Eudes, priest.

      We must strive to follow and fulfill in ourselves the various stages of Christâ€™s plan as well as his mysteries, and frequently beg him to bring them to completion in us and in the whole Church. For the mysteries of Jesus are not yet completely perfected and fulfilled.

      They are complete, indeed, in the person of Jesus, but not in us, who are his members, nor in the Church, which is his mystical body. The Son of God wills to give us a share in his mysteries and somehow to extend them to us. He wills to continue them in us and in his universal Church.

      This is brought about first through the graces he has resolved to impart to us and then through the works he wishes to accomplish in us through these mysteries. This is his plan for fulfilling his mysteries in us.

      For this reason Saint Paul says that Christ is being brought to fulfillment in his Church and that all of us contribute to this fulfillment, and thus he achieves the fullness of life, that is, the mystical stature that he has in his mystical body, which will reach completion only on judgement day. In another place Paul says: "I complete in my own flesh what is lacking in the sufferings of Christ."

      This is the plan by which the Son of God completes and fulfills in us all the various stages and mysteries. He desires us to perfect the mystery of his incarnation and birth by forming himself in us and being reborn in our souls through the blessed sacraments of baptism and the eucharist. He fulfills his interior life in us, hidden with him in God.

      He intends to perfect the mysteries of his passion, death and resurrection, by causing us to suffer, die and rise again with him and in him. Finally, he wishes to fulfill in us the state of his glorious and immortal life, when he will cause us to live a glorious, eternal life with him and in him in heaven.

      In the same way he would complete and fulfill in us and in his Church his other stages and mysteries. He wants to give us a share in them and to accomplish and continue them in us.

      So it is that the mysteries of Christ will not be completed until the end of time, because he has arranged that the completion of his mysteries in us and in the Church will only be achieved at the end of time. 
    responsory:
      - ["I rejoice in my sufferings.","In my body I do all that I can to fill up what has yet to be endured by Christ for the sake of his body, the Church."]
      - ["For this I struggle and press on, with the power of Christ working in me to make me strong.","In my body I do all that I can to fill up what has yet to be endured by Christ for the sake of his body, the Church."]
