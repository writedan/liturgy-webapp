      From the book of the prophet Ezekiel.

      Then he brought me back to the entrance of the temple, and I saw water flowing out from beneath the threshold of the temple toward the east, for the facade of the temple was toward the east; the water flowed down from the southern side of the temple, south of the altar. He led me outside by the north gate, and around to the outer gate facing the east, where I saw water trickling from the southern side.

      Then when he had walked off to the east with a measuring cord in his hand, he measured off a thousand cubits and had me wade through the water, which was ankle-deep. He measured off another thousand and once more had me wade through the water, which was now knee-deep. Again he measured off a thousand and had me wade; the water was up to my waist. Once more he measured off a thousand, but there was now a river through which I could not wade; for the water had risen so high it had become a river that could not be crossed except by swimming. He asked me, "Have you seen this, son of man?" Then he brought me to the bank of the river, where he had me sit.

      Along the bank of the river I saw very many trees on both sides. He said to me, "This water flows into the eastern district down upon the Arabah, and empties into the sea, the salt waters, which it makes fresh. Wherever the river flows, every sort of living creature that can multiply shall live, and there shall be abundant fish, for wherever this water comes the sea shall be made fresh.  Fishermen shall be standing along it from En-gedi to En-eglaim, spreading their nets there. Its kinds of fish shall be like those of the Great Sea, very numerous. Only its marshes and swamps shall not be made fresh; they shall be left for salt.

      Along both banks of the river, fruit trees of every kind shall grow; their leaves shall not fade, nor their fruit fail. Every month they shall bear fresh fruit, for they shall be watered by the flow from the sanctuary. Their fruit shall serve for food, and their leaves for medicine."
    responsory:
      - ["I saw water flowing eastward from beneath the threshold of the temple.","Wherever the water flows, everything shall live."]
      - ["The water I shall give you will become in you a spring welling up to eternal life.","Wherever the water flows, everything shall live."]

      From a discourse on the psalms of Saint Hilary, bishop.

      "The river of God is brimming with water. You have provided their food, for this is your way of preparing them." There can be no doubt about the river referred to, for the prophet says: "There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God"; and in the gospel the Lord himself says: "Streams of living water welling up to eternal life will flow from the heart of anyone who drinks the water I shall give him." He was speaking of the Holy Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive. The river of God is brimming with water; that is to say, we are inundated by the gifts of the Holy Spirit and from that fountain of life the river of God pours into us in a full flood.

      We also have food prepared for us. And who is this food? It is he in whom we are prepared for life with God, for by receiving his holy body we receive a place in the communion of his holy body. This is what is meant by the words of the psalm: "You have provided their food, for this is your way of preparing them." For as well as refreshing us now, that food also prepares us for the life to come.

      We who have been reborn through the sacrament of baptism experience intense joy when we feel within us the first stirrings of the Holy Spirit. We begin to have an insight into the mysteries of faith, we are able to prophesy and to speak with wisdom. We become steadfast in hope and receive the gift of healing. Demons are made subject to our authority. These gifts enter us like a gentle rain, and once having done so, little by little, they bring forth fruit in abundance.
    responsory:
      - ["They will feast on the abundance of your house, O Lord.","You will give them drink from the river of your delight."]
      - ["We shall be filled with the good things of your house.","You will give them drink from the river of your delight."]
