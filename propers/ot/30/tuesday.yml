      From the book of Wisdom.

      The souls of the just are in the hand of God,
       and no torment shall touch them.
      They seemed, in the view of the foolish, to be dead;
       and their passing away was thought an affliction
       and their going forth from us, utter destruction.
      But they are in peace.
      For if before men, indeed, they be punished,
       yet is their hope full of immortality;
      Chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed,
       because God tried them
       and found them worthy of himself.
      As gold in the furnace, he proved them,
       and as sacrificial offerings he took them to himself.
      In the time of their visitation they shall shine,
       and shall dart about as sparks through stubble;
      They shall judge nations and rule over peoples,
       and the Lord shall be their King forever.
      Those who trust in him shall understand truth,
       and the faithful shall abide with him in love:
      Because grace and mercy are with his holy ones,
       and his care is with the elect.

      But the wicked shall receive a punishment to match their thoughts,
       since they neglected justice and forsook the Lord.
      For he who despises wisdom and instruction is doomed.
      Vain is their hope, fruitless are their labors,
       and worthless are their works.
      Their wives are foolish and their children wicked;
       accursed is their brood.

      Yes, blessed is she who, childless and undefiled,
       knew not transgression of the marriage bed;
       she shall bear fruit at the visitation of souls.
      So also the eunuch whose hand wrought no misdeed,
       who held no wicked thoughts against the Lord -
      For he shall be given fidelity's choice reward
       and a more gratifying heritage in the Lord's temple.
      For the fruit of noble struggles is a glorious one;
       and unfailing is the root of understanding.

      But the children of adulterers will remain without issue,
       and the progeny of an unlawful bed will disappear.
      For should they attain long life, they will be held in no esteem,
       and dishonored will their old age be at last;
      While should they die abruptly,
       they have no hope nor comfort in the day of scrutiny;
       for dire is the end of the wicked generation.
    responsory:
      - ["The Lord tested his chosen ones like gold tested by fire; he has received them as a sacrificial offering; at the time of his visitation men shall see.","For grace and mercy shall be given to his chosen ones."]
      - ["Those who trust in him shall understand truth and the faithful shall live with him in love.","For grace and mercy shall be given to his chosen ones."]

      From a letter to the Corinthians by Saint Clement, pope.

      Consider, beloved, how the Lord keeps reminding us of the resurrection that is to come, of which he has made the Lord Jesus Christ the first fruits by raising him from the dead. Let us look, beloved, at the resurrection that occurs as its appointed time. Day and night show us a resurrection; the night lies in sleep, day rises again; the day departs, night takes its place. Let us think about the harvest; how does the sowing take place, and in what manner? The sower goes out and casts each seed onto the ground. Dry and bare, they fall into the earth and decay. Then the greatness of the Lordâ€™s providence raises them up again from decay, and out of one many are produced and yield fruit.

      In this hope, then, let our hearts be bound fast to him who is faithful in his promises and just in his judgments. He forbade us to tell lies; still less will he himself tell a lie. Nothing is impossible for God except to tell a lie. Then let our faith in him be awakened; let us reflect that everything is close to him.

      By the word of his power he established all things, and by his word he can reduce them to ruin. "Who shall say to him: What have you done? Who shall stand up against the power of his might?" He will accomplish everything when he wills and as he wills, and nothing that he has decreed shall pass away. All things stand in his presence, and nothing lies hidden from his counsel, "if the heavens tell forth the glory of God, the firmament reveals the work of his hands, day speaks to day, and night shares knowledge with night; there are no words, no speeches, and their voices are not heard."

      Since all things lie open to his eyes and ears, let us hold him in awe and rid ourselves of impure desires to do works of evil, so that we may be protected by his mercy from the judgment that is to come. Which of us can escape his mighty hand? What world will give asylum to one who deserts him? Where will I go, where will I hide from his face? If I go up to heaven, you are there; if I go to the limits of the earth, your right hand is there; if I lie down in the deep, your spirit is there. Where, then, can one go, where can one escape to, from the presence of him whose hands embrace the universe?

      Let us then approach him in holiness of soul, raising up to him hands pure and undefiled, out of love for our good and merciful Father who made us a chosen portion for himself.
    responsory:
      - ["O Lord, ruler of all creation, the whole universe is subject to your authority, and no one can oppose your will.","Free us for the sake of your love."]
      - ["You fashioned the heavens and the earth and every wonderful thing under heaven.","Free us for the sake of your love."]
