      From the book of Wisdom.

      It was the wicked who with hands and words invited death,
        considered it a friend, and pined for it,
        and made a covenant with it,
      Because they deserve to be in its possession,
        they who said among themselves, thinking not aright:
      "Let us oppress the needy just man;
        let us neither spare the widow
        nor revere the old man for his hair grown white with time.
      But let our strength be our norm of justice;
        for weakness proves itself useless.
      Let us beset the just one, because he is obnoxious to us;
        he sets himself against our doings,
      Reproaches us for transgressions of the law
        and charges us with violations of our training.

      "He professes to have knowledge of God
        and styles himself a child of the Lord.
      To us he is the censure of our thoughts;
        merely to see him is a hardship for us,
      Because his life is not like other men's,
        and different are his ways.
      He judges us debased;
        he holds aloof from our paths as from things impure.
      He calls blest the destiny of the just
        and boasts that God is his Father.

      "Let us see whether his words be true;
        let us find out what will happen to him.
      For if the just one be the son of God, he will defend him
        and deliver him from the hand of his foes.
      With revilement and torture let us put him to the test
        that we may have proof of his gentleness
        and try his patience.
      Let us condemn him to a shameful death;
        for according to his own words, God will take care of him."

      These were their thoughts, but they erred;
        for their wickedness blinded them,
      And they knew not the hidden counsels of God;
        neither did they count on a recompense of holiness
        nor discern the innocent souls' reward.
      For God formed man to be imperishable;
        the image of his own nature he made him.
      But by the envy of the devil, death entered the world,
        and they who are in his possession experience it.
    responsory:
      - ["The wicked said: Let us be in wait for the just man, for he disapproves of our way of life and calls himself the son of God.","Let us test the truth of his words; God will deliver him from the hands of his enemies, if he truly is his son."]
      - ["He trusted in God; let God rescue him if he wants him, for he said: I am the Son of God.","Let us test the truth of his words; God will deliver him from the hands of his enemies, if he truly is his son."]

      From a letter to the Corinthians by Saint Clement, pope.

      Dear friends take care that God’s blessings, which are many, do not become the condemnation of us all; we must live lives worthy of him and in mutual harmony do what is good and acceptable in his sight. He tells us: "The Spirit of the Lord is a lantern, searching the hidden places of our inmost being."

      We must remember how near he is and that no thought of ours, no conversation we hold is hidden from him. It is right, therefore, that we should not turn our backs and flee from God’s will. We should rather give offense to stupid and foolish men, puffed up and taking pride in their boastful speech, than give offense to God.

      Let us reverence the Lord Jesus, whose blood was shed for us. Let us respect those in authority, let us honor the presbyters. Let us train the young in the fear of God. Let us lead our wives toward all that is good. Let them show by their conduct that they are lovers of chastity; by their gentleness let them reveal a pure and sincere disposition; by their silence let them manifest the control they have over their tongues; let them bestow an equal charity, without respect for persons, on all who have a holy fear of God.

      Your children must share in the way of discipleship in Christ. They must learn how effective humility is before God, what chaste love can accomplish with God, how good and noble is the fear of God, for it brings salvation to all who possess it and who live holy lives with a pure heart. The one whose Spirit is in us is the searcher of our thoughts and of the counsels of our hearts. At his will, he shall take that Spirit from us.

      All this is strengthened by the faith that comes to us in Christ. He himself addresses us through the Holy Spirit and says: "Come, my children, listen to me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Is there a man who wants life, desiring to see good days? Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking what is false. Turn away from evil and do good. Seek peace and go in pursuit of it."

      The Father is merciful in all he does and full of generosity; he is loving to those who fear him. In goodness and gentleness he gives his graces to those who approach him with undivided hearts. We must then put away all duplicity and not be distrustful in the face of his excelling and ennobling gifts.
    responsory:
      - ["Bless the Lord God at all times, and ask him to guide you in his paths.","So that all you do may be rooted in him."]
      - ["Ask God to guide you, that you may do what is pleasing to him in sincerity and with all your strength.","So that all you do may be rooted in him."]
