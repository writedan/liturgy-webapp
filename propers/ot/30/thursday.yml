      From the book of Wisdom.

      Now God grant I speak suitably
        and value these endowments at their worth:
      For he is the guide of Wisdom
        and the director of the wise.
      For both we and our words are in his hand,
        as well as all prudence and knowledge of crafts.
      For he gave me sound knowledge of existing things,
        that I might know the organization of the universe and the force of its elements,
      The beginning and the end and the midpoint of times,
        the changes in the sun's course and the variations of the seasons.
      Cycles of years, positions of the stars,
        natures of animals, tempers of beasts,
      Powers of the winds and thoughts of men,
        uses of plants and virtues of roots-
      Such things as are hidden I learned and such as are plain;
        for Wisdom, the artificer of all, taught me.
      For in her is a spirit
        intelligent, holy, unique,
      Manifold, subtle, agile,
        clear, unstained, certain,
      Not baneful, loving the good, keen,
        unhampered, beneficent, kindly,
      Firm, secure, tranquil,
        all-powerful, all-seeing,
      And pervading all spirits,
        though they be intelligent, pure and very subtle.
      For Wisdom is mobile beyond all motion,
        and she penetrates and pervades all things by reason of her purity.

      For she is an aura of the might of God
        and a pure effusion of the glory of the Almighty;
        therefore nought that is sullied enters into her.
      For she is the refulgence of eternal light,
        the spotless mirror of the power of God,
        the image of his goodness.
      And she, who is one, can do all things,
        and renews everything while herself perduring;
      And passing into holy souls from age to age,
        she produces friends of God and prophets.
      For there is nought God loves, be it not one who dwells with Wisdom.
      For she is fairer than the sun
        and surpasses every constellation of the stars.
      Compared to light, she takes precedence;
        for that, indeed, night supplants,
        but wickedness prevails not over Wisdom.
    responsory:
      - ["Christ Jesus is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.","For in him, all things were created."]
      - ["He is the brightness of the eternal light and the image of God's goodness.","For in him, all things were created."]

      From a discourse against the Arians by Saint Athanasius, bishop.

      An impress of Wisdom has been created in us and in all his works. Therefore, the true Wisdom which shaped the world claims for himself all that bears his image, and rightly says: "The Lord created me in his works." These words are really spoken by the wisdom that is in us, but the Lord himself here adopts them as his own. Wisdom himself is not created, because he is the Creator, but by reason of the created image of himself found in his works, he speaks thus as though he were speaking of himself. Our Lord said: "He who receives you receives me," and he could say this because the impress of himself is in us. In the same way, although Wisdom is not to be numbered among created things, yet because his form and likeness is in his works, he speaks as if he were a creature, and says: "The Lord created me in his works, when his purpose first unfolded."

      The likeness of Wisdom has been stamped upon creatures in order that the world may recognize in it the Word who was its maker and through the Word come to know the Father. This is Paul's teaching: "What can be known about God is clear to them, for God has shown it to them. Ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature has been there for the mind to perceive in things that have been made." Accordingly the Word is not a creature, for the passage that begins: "The Lord created me..." is to be understood as referring to that wisdom which is truly in us and is said to be so.

      But if this fails to persuade our opponents, let them tell us whether there is any wisdom in created things. If there is none, why does the apostle Paul allege as the cause of men's sins: "By God's wisdom, the world failed to come to a knowledge of God through wisdom?" And if there is no created wisdom, how is it that the expression a multitude of wise men is found in Scripture? And again, Scripture testifies that "the wise man is wary and turns away from evil, and by wisdom is a house built." Further, Ecclesiastes says: "A wise man's wisdom will light up his face." He also rebukes presumptuous persons with the warning: "Do not say, 'How is it that former days were better than these?' For it is not in wisdom that you ask this."

      So there is a wisdom in created things, as the son of Sirach too bears witness: "The Lord has poured it out upon all his works, to be with men as his gift, and with wisdom he has abundantly equipped those who love him." This quality of being "poured out" belongs not to the essence of that self-existent Wisdom who is the Only-begotten, but to that wisdom which reflects the only begotten on in the world. Why then is it beyond belief if the creative and archetypal Wisdom, whose likeness is the wisdom and understanding poured out in the world, should say, as though speaking directly of himself: "The Lord created me in his works"? For the wisdom in the world is not creative, but is itself created in God's works, and in the light of this wisdom "the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands."
    responsory:
      - ["In wisdom dwells a spirit, intelligent, holy, unique, manifold, subtle, active, loving all that is good, and irrestistible.","This is an all-powerful spirit, surveying all and pervading all spirits."]
      - ["The Spirit penetrates the depths of all that is, even the depths of God.","This is an all-powerful spirit, surveying all and pervading all spirits."]
