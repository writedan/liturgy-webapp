      From the book of Wisdom.

      Hear, therefore, kings, and understand;
        learn, you magistrates of the earth's expanse!
      Hearken, you who are in power over the multitude
        and lord it over throngs of peoples!
      Because authority was given you by the Lord
        and sovereignty by the Most High,
      who shall probe your works
        and scrutinize your counsels!

      Because, though you were ministers of his kingdom,
        you judged not rightly, and did not keep the law,
        nor walk according to the will of God,
      Terribly and swiftly shall he come against you,
        because judgment is stern for the exalted -
      For the lowly may be pardoned out of mercy
        but the mighty shall be mightily put to the test.
      For the Lord of all shows no partiality,
        nor does he fear greatness,
      Because he himself made the great as well as the small,
        and he provides for all alike;
        but for those in power a rigorous scrutiny impends.

      To you, therefore, O princes,
        are my words addressed
        that you may learn wisdom
        and that you may not sin.
      For those who keep the holy precepts hallowed
        shall be found holy,
        and those learned in them
        will have ready a response.
      Desire therefore my words;
        long for them and you shall be instructed.

      Resplendent and unfading is Wisdom,
        and she is readily perceived by those who love her,
        and found by those who seek her.
      She hastens to make herself known
        in anticipation of men's desire;
        he who watches for her at dawn shall not be disappointed,
        for he shall find her sitting by his gate.

      For taking thought of her
        is the perfection of prudence,
        and he who for her sake keeps vigil
        shall quickly be free from care;
      Because she makes her own rounds,
        seeking those worthy of her,
        and graciously appears to them in the ways,
        and meets them with all solicitude.

      For the first step toward discipline
        is a very earnest desire for her;
        then, care for discipline is love of her;
        love means the keeping of her laws;
      To observe her laws
        is the basis for incorruptibility;
        and incorruptibility makes one close to God;
        thus the desire for Wisdom leads up to a kingdom.

      If, then, you find pleasure in throne and scepter,
        you princes of the peoples, honor Wisdom,
        that you may reign as kings forever.
      Now what wisdom is, and how she came to be I shall relate;
        and I shall hide no secrets from you,
      But from the very beginning I shall search out
        and bring to light knowledge of her,
        nor shall I diverge from the truth.
      Neither shall I admit consuming jealousy to my company,
        because that can have no fellowship with Wisdom.

      A great number of wise men is the safety of the world,
        and a prudent king, the stability of his people;
        so take instruction from my words, to your profit.
    responsory:
      - ["With pure intention I learned wisdom and ungrudgingly I now share it.","For wisdom is an unfailing treasure for all peoples."]
      - ["Wretched is the man who rejects wisdom; God loves only the man who lives with wisdom.","For wisdom is an unfailing treasure for all peoples."]

      From a letter to the Corinthians by Saint Clement, pope.

      Let us put on the unity of mind, thinking humble thoughts, exercising self-control, keeping ourselves far from all backbiting and slander, being righteous in deed, and not in word only. Scripture says: "He who says much hears much in his own turn. Or does the easy talker think that he is righteous?"

      It is our duty then to be eager to do good, for everything is from God. He warns us: "See, the Lord is coming, and the reward he brings is before him, for paying each according to his work." He urges us, who believe in him with all our heart, not to be idle or careless in any good work. Our boasting and our confidence must rest on him. Let us be subject to his will. Let us look carefully at the whole host of his angels; they stand ready and serve his will. Scripture says: "Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him, and a thousand thousand served him, and cried out: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole creation is full of his glory."

      We, too, dutifully gathered together in unity of mind, should cry out to him continuously as with one voice so as to share in his great and glorious promises. It is written: "Eye has not seen, ear has not heard, man’s heart has not conceived, what great things have been prepared for those who wait for him."

      Beloved, how blessed, how wonderful, are God’s gifts! Life with immortality, glory with righteousness, truth with confidence, self-control with holiness: all these are the gifts that fall within our understanding. What then are those gifts that are in store for those who wait for him? Only the most holy Creator and Father of the ages knows their greatness and their splendor.

      We should then strive with the greatest zeal to be found among the number of those who await him, so that we may share in the promised gifts. How will this be, beloved? If our mind is fixed on God through faith, if we are diligent in seeking what is pleasing and acceptable to him, if we fulfill what is according to his blameless will and follow the way of truth, casting away from ourselves all that is unholy.
    responsory:
      - ["Lord, show me your ways, teach me to walk in your footsteps; guide me in your truth.","You are the God of my salvation, and I wait for you all day long."]
      - ["Look on me, Lord, and have pity on me, for I am poor and lone.","You are the God of my salvation, and I wait for you all day long."]
