    cite: Esther 14:1-19
    text: |
      From the book of Esther.

      Queen Esther, seized with mortal anguish, likewise had recourse to the Lord. Taking off her splendid garments, she put on garments of distress and mourning. In place of her precious ointments she covered her head with dirt and ashes. She afflicted her body severely; all her festive adornments were put aside, and her hair was wholly disheveled.

      Then she prayed to the Lord, the God of Israel, saying: "My Lord, our King, you alone are God. Help me, who am alone and have no help but you, for I am taking my life in my hand.

      "As a child I was wont to hear from the people of the land of my forefathers that you, O Lord, chose Israel from among all peoples, and our fathers from among all their ancestors, as a lasting heritage, and that you fulfilled all your promises to them.

      "But now we have sinned in your sight, and you have delivered us into the hands of our enemies, because we worshiped their gods. You are just, O Lord.

      "But now they are not satisfied with our bitter servitude, but have undertaken to do away with the decree you have pronounced, and to destroy your heritage; to close the mouths of those who praise you, and to extinguish the glory of your temple and your altar; to open the mouths of the heathen to acclaim their false gods, and to extol an earthly king forever.

      "O Lord, do not relinquish your scepter to those that are nought. Let them not gloat over our ruin, but turn their own counsel against them and make an example of our chief enemy. Be mindful of us, O Lord. Manifest yourself in the time of our distress and give me courage, King of gods and Ruler of every power. Put in my mouth persuasive words in the presence of the lion, and turn his heart to hatred for our enemy, so that he and those who are in league with him may perish.

      "Save us by your power, and help me, who am alone and have no one but you, O Lord. You know all things. You know that I hate the glory of the pagans, and abhor the bed of the uncircumcised or of any foreigner.

      "You know that I am under constraint, that I abhor the sign of grandeur which rests on my head when I appear in public; abhor it like a polluted rag, and do not wear it in private.  I, your handmaid, have never eaten at the table of Haman, nor have I graced the banquet of the king or drunk the wine of libations. From the day I was brought here till now, your handmaid has had no joy except in you, O Lord, God of Abraham.

      "O God, more powerful than all, hear the voice of those in despair. Save us from the power of the wicked, and deliver me from my fear."
    responsory:
      - ["King of the saints, all powerful Lord, give me courage.","Put the right words into my mouth, that I may speak wisely."]
      - ["Give us some time for repentance and do not silence those who sing your praise, O Lord.","Put the right words into my mouth, that I may speak wisely."]

      From a letter to Proba by Saint Augustine, bishop.

      We read, for example: "May you receive glory among all the nations as  you have among us, and May your prophets prove themselves faithful." What does this mean but "Hallowed be your name"?

      We read: "Lord of power and might, touch our hearts and show us your face, and we shall be saved." What does this mean but "Your kingdom come"?

      We read: "Direct my ways by your word, and let no sin rule over me." What does this mean but "Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven"?

      We read: "Do not give me poverty or riches." What does this mean but "Give us this day our daily bread"?

      We read: "Lord, remember David and all his patient suffering", and "Lord, if I have done this, if there is guilt on my hands, if I have repaid evil for evil." What does this mean but "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us"?

      We read: "Rescue me, God, from my enemies, deliver me from those who rise up against me." What does this mean but "Deliver us from evil"?

      If you study every word of the petitions of Scripture, you will find, I think, nothing that is not contained and included in the Lord's Prayer. When we pray, then, we may use different words to say the same things, but we may not say different things.

      We should not hesitate to make these prayers for ourselves, for our friends, for strangers, and even for enemies, though the emotions in our heart may vary with the strength or weakness of our relationships with individuals.

      You now know, I think, the attitudes you should bring to prayer, as well as the petitions you should make, and this not because of what I have taught you but thanks to the teaching of the one who has been pleased to teach us all.

      We must search out the life of happiness, we must ask for it from the Lord our God. Many have discussed at great length the meaning of happiness, but surely we do not need to go to them and their long drawn out discussions. Holy Scripture says concisely and with truth: "Happy is the people whose God is the Lord." We are meant to belong to that people, and to be able to see God and live with him for ever, and so the object of this command is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience and a sincere faith.

      In these three qualities, "a good conscience" stands for "hope." Faith, hope and love bring safely to God the person who prays, that is, the person who believes, who hopes, who desires, and who ponders what he is asking of the Lord in the Lord's Prayer.
    responsory:
      - ["Listen to my prayer, O Lord; hear my cry for help.","O God, you will not scorn the prayer of the poor."]
      - ["Listen attentively to my plea for help.","O God, you will not scorn the prayer of the poor."]
