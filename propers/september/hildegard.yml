  Bestow your mercy upon us, Lord, we pray, that we we rejoice with loving devotion on the feast day of the virgin blessed Hildegard, so by your gift we may know the eternal delight of her company: through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
