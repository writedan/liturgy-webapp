This schedule is tentative based on the needs of the community. Mass in particular is completely unknown, and this schedule makes no adjustment to its eventual location, other than the assumption the sole Sunday Mass is at 11:15am. In particular, Mass cannot be celebrated after Vespers, which would cause issue if the Tuesday 8pm Mass is to be retained.
