  O God, who by the fruitful virginity of blessed Mary has bestowed upon mankind the reward of eternal salvation, grant, we pray, that we may know the help of her intercession, through whom we have been made worthy to receive the author of life, our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son: who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
