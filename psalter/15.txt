Psalm 15
Lord, who shall be admitted to your tent
and dwell on your holy mountain?

The man who walks without fault,
who acts with justice
and speaks the truth from his heart,
he who does not slander with his tongue,

who does no wrong to his kindred,
who casts no slur on his neighbors,
who holds the godless in disdain,
but honors those who fear the Lord;

those who keep their word, come what may,
who take no interest on a loan
and accept no bribes against the innocent.
Such people will stand firm for ever.
