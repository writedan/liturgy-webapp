Psalm 119:49-56 - Zain
Remember your word to your servant
by which you gave me hope.
This is my comfort in sorrow:
that your promise gives me life.

Though the proud may utterly deride me
I keep to your law.
I remember your decrees of old
and these, Lord, console me.

I am seized with indignation at the wicked
who forsake your law.
Your statutes have become my song
in the land of exile.

I think of your name in the nighttime
and I keep your law.
This has been my blessing,
the keeping of your precepts.
