Psalm 119:1-8 - Aleph
They are happy whose life is blameless,
who follow God's law!
They are happy who do his will,
seeking him with all their hearts,

who never do anything evil
but walk in his ways.
You have laid down your precepts
to be obeyed with care.

May my footsteps be firm
to obey your statutes.
Then I shall not be put to shame
as I heed your commands.

I will thank you with an upright heart
as I learn your decrees.
I will obey your statutes;
do not forsake me.
