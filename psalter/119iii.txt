Psalm 119:17-24 - Gimel
Bless your servant and I shall live
and obey your word.
Open my eyes that I may see
the wonders of your law.

I am a pilgrim on the earth;
show me your commands.
My soul is ever consumed
as I long for your decrees.

You threaten the proud, the accursed,
who turn from your commands.
Relieve me from scorn and contempt
for I do your will.

Though the princes sit plotting against me
I ponder on your statutes.
Your will is my delight;
your statutes are my counselors.
