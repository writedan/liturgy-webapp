Psalm 53
The fool has said in his heart:
There is no God above.
Their deeds are corrupt, depraved;
not a good man is left.

God looks down from heaven
on the sons of men
to see if any are wise,
if any seek God.

All have left the right path;
depraved, every one;
There is not a good man left,
no, not even one.

Will the evil-doers not understand?
They eat up my people
as though they were eating bread;
they never pray to God.

See how they tremble with fear
without cause for fear,
for God scatters the bones of the wicked.
They are shamed, God rejects them.

O that Israel's salvation might come from Zion!
When God delivers his people from bondage,
then Jacob will be glad and Israel rejoice.
