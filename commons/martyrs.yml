            From the letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Romans.

            I consider the sufferings of the present to be as nothing compared with the glory to be revealed in us. Indeed, the whole created world eagerly awaits the revelation of the sons of God. Creation was made subject to futility, not of its own accord but by him who once subjected it; yet not without hope, because the world itself will be freed from its slavery to corruption and share in the glorious freedom of the children of God. Yes, we know that all creation groans and is in agony even until now. Not only that, but we ourselves, although we have the Spirit as first fruits, groan inwardly while we await the redemption of our bodies. In hope we were saved. But hope is not hope if its object is seen; how is it possible for one to hope for what he sees? And hoping for what we cannot see means awaiting it with patient endurance.

            The Spirit too helps us in our weakness, for we do not know how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in speech. He who searches hearts knows what the Spirit means, for the Spirit intercedes for the saints as God himself wills.

            We know that God makes all things work together for the good of those who love him who have been called according to his decree. Those whom he foreknew he predestined to share the image of his Son, that the Son might be the first-born of many brothers.  Those he predestined he likewise called; those he called he also justified; and those he justified he in turn glorified.

            What shall we say after that? If God is for us, who can be against us? Is it possible that he who did not spare his own Son but handed him over for the sake of us all will not grant us all things besides? Who shall bring a charge against God's chosen ones? God, who justifies? Who shall condemn them? Christ Jesus, who died or rather was raised up, who is at the right hand of God and who intercedes for us?

            Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Trial, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or the sword? As Scripture says: "For your sake we are being slain all the day long; we are looked upon as sheep to be slaughtered. Yet in all this we are more than conquerors because of him who had loved us. For I am certain that neither death nor life neither angels nor principalities, neither the present nor the future, nor powers, neither height nor depth nor any other creature, will be able to separate us from the love of God that comes to us in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
        responsory:
            - ["Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you; pray for those who persecute and insult you.","Then you will be true sons of your Father who is in heaven."]
            - ["You must be perfect just as your heavenly Father is perfect.","Then you will be true sons of your Father who is in heaven."]

        text: |
            From a letter of Saint Cyprian, bishop and martyr.

            I greet you, dearest brothers, and would like also to enjoy your company face to face, if only the conditions in which I find myself did not prevent my coming to see you. What could be more desirable or more joyful for me than to embrace you now, to be encircled by those pure and sinless hands that have kept the faith of the Lord and refused to offer sacrilegious worship?

            What could be more pleasant, more sublime, than to kiss at this moment those lips of yours, which have given such glorious utterance in praise of the Lord; to be seen also by those eyes of yours, which have despised the world and proved themselves worthy of seeing God?

            But, because there is no opportunity for my sharing this joy, I send this letter as my representative for your ears and eyes to hear and see. Through it I congratulate you, and at the same time urge you to persevere courageously and steadfastly in your witness to heavenly glory, and to continue with spiritual courage, now that you have entered on the way that the Lord has graciously opened up for you, until you receive the crown of victory. You have the Lord as your protector and guide, for he has said: "Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the world."

            How blessed is the prison honored by your presence, how blessed the prison honored by your presence, how blessed the prison that sends men of god to heaven! Darkness brighter than the sun  itself, more resplendent than this light of the world, for it is here that God's temples are now established, and your limbs made holy by your praise of God.

            Let nothing else be now in your hearts and minds except God's commandments and the precepts of heaven: by their means the Holy Spirit has always inspired you to bear your sufferings. Let no one think of death, but only of immortality; let no one think of suffering that is for a time, but only of glory that is for eternity. It is written: "Precious in the sight of God is the death of his holy ones." And again: "A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit; a broken and humbled heart God does not despise."

            Holy Scripture speaks also of the sufferings which consecrate God's martyrs and sanctify them by the very testing of pain: "Though in the eyes of men they suffered torments, their hope is full of immortality. They will judge nations, and rule over the peoples, and the Lord will reign over them forever."

            When , therefore, you recall that you will be judges and rulers with Christ the Lord, you must rejoice, despising present suffering for you at what is to come. You know that from the beginning of the world it was so; justice is here oppressed in its conflict with the world, for at the very outset Abel the just is killed, and after him the just, and those sent as prophets and apostles.

            The Lord himself is an example of all this in his own person. He teaches us that only those who have followed him along his way arrive at his kingdom: He who loves his life in this world, will lose it. "And he who hates his life in this world, will save it for eternal life. And again he says: Do not fear those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul; fear rather him who can kill both body and soul and send them to hell."

            Paul too admonishes us, that as we desire to gain the Lord's promises we must imitate the Lord in all things. "We are God's children," he tells us. "If children, we area also heirs of God, and coheirs with Christ, if only we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him."

            - ["Let us arm ourselves in full strength and prepare ourselves for the ultimate struggle with blameless hearts, true faith, and unyielding courage.","What honor and glory and joy, to do battle in the presence of God and to have Christ approve our victory?"]
