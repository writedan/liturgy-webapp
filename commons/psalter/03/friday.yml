        As to the extraordinary revelations, that I might not become too conceited,  a thorn in the flesh was given to me, an angel of Satan, to beat me, to keep me from being too elated. Three times  I begged the Lord about this, that it might leave me, but he said to me,  "My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness." I will rather boast most gladly of my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may dwell with me.

      text: "Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you encounter various trials, for you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. And let perseverance be perfect, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. But if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly, and he will be given it. But he should ask in faith, not doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed about by the wind. For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord, since he is a man of two minds, unstable in all his ways."

        - ["Your apostle said: \"Where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more.\"","Forgive us our transgressions."]
        - ["Lord, we have sinned, yet we have also acknowledged your infinite mercy.","Bring us to conversion."]
