      text: "Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, with the same love, united in heart, thinking one thing. Do nothing out of selfishness or out of vainglory; rather, humbly regard others as more important than yourselves, each looking out not for his own interests, but also everyone for those of others. Do everything without grumbling or questioning, that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine like lights in the world, as you hold on to the word of life, so that my boast for the day of Christ may be that I did not run in vain or labor in vain."

    text: >-
      Does the Lord so delight in holocausts and sacrifices
        as in obedience to the command of the Lord?
      Obedience is better than sacrifice,
        and submission than the fat of rams.
    responsory:
      - "A sacrifice of praise will give me glory."
      - "To the pure of heart I will show myself a savior."
