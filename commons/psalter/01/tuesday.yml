          See what love the Father has bestowed on us
          that we may be called the children of God.
          Yet so we are.
          The reason the world does not know us
          is that it did not know him.
          Beloved,
          we are God's children now;
          what we shall be has not yet been revealed.
          We do know that when it is revealed
          we shall be like him,
          for we shall see him as he is.
          Everyone who has this hope based on him
          makes himself pure, as he is pure.

            - "Through all eternity, O Lord, your promise stands unshaken."

        - ["You made captive our captivity.","To our brothers who are enduring bodily or spiritual chains, grant the freedom of the sons and daughters of God."]
        - ["May our young people be concerned with remaining blameless in your sight.","And may they generously follow your call."]

    text: |
      Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord,
        whose trust is the Lord.
      They shall be like a tree planted by water,
        sending out its roots by the stream.
      It shall not fear when heat comes,
        and its leaves shall stay green;
      in the year of drought it is not anxious,
        and it does not cease to bear fruit.
    responsory:
      - "God cares for the needs of those who follow him."
      - "Lord, God of hosts, happy is the man who trusts in you."
