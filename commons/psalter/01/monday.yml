    text: >-
      Owe nothing to anyone, except to love one another; for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. The commandments, "You shall not commit adultery; you shall not kill; you shall not steal; you shall not covet," and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this saying, namely "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." Love does no evil to the neighbor; hence, love is the fulfillment of the law.
    responsory:
      - "Stand by me, God, do not for sake me."
      - "Do not abandon me, my Savior."
