      From the book of Wisdom.

      I prayed, and prudence was given me;
        I pleaded and the spirit of Wisdom came to me.
      I preferred her to scepter and throne,
      And deemed riches nothing in comparison with her,
        nor did I liken any priceless gem to her;
      Because all gold, in view of her, is a little sand,
        and before her, siålver is to be accounted mire.
      Beyond health and comeliness I loved her,
        And I chose to have her rather than the light,
        because the splendor of her never yields to sleep.
      Yet all good things together came to me in her company,
        and countless riches at her hands;
      And I rejoiced in them all, because Wisdom is their leader,
        though I had not known that she is the mother of these.
      Simply I learned about her, and ungrudgingly do I share -
        her riches I do not hide away;
      For to men she is an unfailing treasure;
        those who gain this treasure win the friendship of God,
        to whom the gifts they have from discipline commend them.

      Now God grant I speak suitably
        and value these endowments at their worth:
      For he is the guide of Wisdom
        and the director of the wise.
      For both we and our words are in his hand,
        as well as all prudence and knowledge of crafts.

      For in her is a spirit
        intelligent, holy, unique,
      Manifold, subtle, agile,
        clear, unstained, certain,
      Not baneful, loving the good, keen,
        unhampered, beneficent, kindly,
      Firm, secure, tranquil,
        all-powerful, all-seeing,
      And pervading all spirits,
        though they be intelligent, pure and very subtle.
      For Wisdom is mobile beyond all motion,
        and she penetrates and pervades all things by reason of her purity.

      For she is an aura of the might of God
        and a pure effusion of the glory of the Almighty;
        therefore nought that is sullied enters into her.
      For she is the refulgence of eternal light,
        the spotless mirror of the power of God,
        the image of his goodness.

      And she, who is one, can do all things,
        and renews everything while herself perduring;
      And passing into holy souls from age to age,
        she produces friends of God and prophets.
      For there is nought God loves, be it not one who dwells with Wisdom.
      For she is fairer than the sun
        and surpasses every constellation of the stars.
      Compared to light, she takes precedence;
        for that, indeed, night supplants,
        but wickedness prevails not over Wisdom.
    responsory:
      - ["I prayed for understanding, and it was given to me.","I pleaded for wisdom, and the spirit of wisdom came to me; I valued her more than all the earthly power and glory."]
      - ["If any one of you lacks wisdom, he has only to turn to God in prayer and it will be given to him: for God gives generously to all and turns no one away.","I pleaded for wisdom, and the spirit of wisdom came to me; I valued her more than all the earthly power and glory."]

      From the "Mirror of Faith" by William of Thierry, abbot.

      When in your life of faith you are confronted with the deeper mysteries it is natural to become a little frightened. When this happens, take heart faithful Christian. Do not raise objections, but ask with loving submission, “How can these things be?” Let your question be a prayer, an expression of love and self-surrender to God. Let it be an expression of your humble desire not to penetrate his sublime majesty, but to find salvation through the saving deeds of God our Savior.

      Then the Angel of good counsel will reply: When the Paraclete comes, whom I shall send you from the Father, he will remind you of everything and teach you all truth. Even as no one knows a man’s secret thoughts except his own spirit within him, so no one comprehends the mysteries of God except the Spirit of God.

      Hasten therefore to receive the Holy Spirit. He is with you when you call upon him; you can call upon him only because he is already present. But when he comes in answer to your prayer, he comes with an abundance of divine blessings; he is the river whose stream gives joy to the city of God.

      If when he comes he finds you humble, silent and trembling at the words of God, he will rest upon you and reveal what God the Father has hidden from the wise and the prudent of this world. You will then begin to understand the things holy Wisdom could have told his disciples on earth, but which they were unable to bear until the Spirit of truth came who was to teach them all truth. For this reason we cannot hope to learn from the lips of any man truths that Truth himself could not convey. As he himself has told us: God is Spirit. As those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth, so those who wish to know him must seek understanding of their faith and perception of its pure and simple truth only in the Holy Spirit.

      In the darkness and ignorance of this life, the Holy Spirit enlightens the poor in spirit. He is the love that draws them on, the sweetness that attracts them, the way in which a man approaches God. He is the love of the lover. He is devotion. He is piety. From one degree of faith to the next he is ever revealing to believers the justice of God, so that grace follows grace, and the faith that comes from hearing yields to a faith enlightened by understanding.
